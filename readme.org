* About

[[https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/][Recoll]] is a local search engine that knows how to index a wide variety of file
formats, including PDFs, org and other text files and emails.  It also offers
a sophisticated query language, and, for some document kinds, snippets in the
the found documents actually matching the query at hand.

This package provides an emacs interface to perform recoll queries, and
display its results, via [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]].  It is also recommened that you use a a
package for vertical display of completions that works well with /consult/, such
as [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]].

[[https://codeberg.org/jao/consult-recoll/raw/branch/main/consult-recoll.png]]

This package is part of [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/consult-recoll.html][GNU ELPA]], so for recent Emacs versions you can install
it directly via =M-x package-install RET consult-recoll RET=.

* Searching

    The entry point of ~consult-recoll~ is the interactive command
    =consult-recoll=. Just invoke it (e.g., via =M-x consult-recoll=) to perform
    any query and get its results dynamically displayed in the minibuffer,
    with "live" updates as the query changes.  Selecting any of the candidate
    results will open the associated file, using the functions in
    ~consult-recoll-open-fns~ (see [[#opening-results][Opening search results]] below).

    By default, your input will be interpreted as a recoll query, in the
    recoll query language (so you can issue queries like "author:jao@foo.io"
    or "dir:/home/jao/docs mime:application/pdf where is wally", and so on).
    You can fine tune how queries are issued by customizing
    ~consult-recoll-search-flags~.

** Tip: Two-level filtering

      ~consult-recoll~ builds on the asychronous logic inside =consult.el=,
      so you can use consult's handy [[https://github.com/minad/consult#asynchronous-search][two-level filtering]], which allows
      searching over the results of a query. For example, if you start
      typing

      #+begin_example
       #goedel's theorem
      #+end_example

      see a bunch of results, and want to narrow them to those lines
      matching, say, "hofstadter", you can type ~#~ (which stops further
      recoll queries) followed by the term you're interested in:

      #+begin_example
        #goedel's theorem#hofstadter
      #+end_example

      at which point only matches containing "hofstadter" will be
      offered.

* Displaying results

   For each matching result, ~consult-recoll~ retrieves its title, full file
   name and mime type, and shows, by default, a line with the first two in the
   minibuffer, using the customizable faces ~consult-recoll-title-face~ and
   ~consult-recoll-url-face~.  You can provide your own formatting function
   (perhaps stripping common prefixes of the file name, or displaying also the
   MIME) as the value of the customizable variable
   ~consult-recoll-format-candidate~.

   By default, ~consult-recoll~ uses consult's [[https://github.com/minad/consult#live-previews][live previews]] to show, for each
   selected candidate hit, a buffer with further information, including
   snippets of the file (when provided by recoll).  The title, path and mime
   type of the document are also shown in previews.

   See [[#opening-results][Opening search results]] below for ways of customizing how Emacs will
   open selected results.

** Example: formatting results list
    As mentioned, one can use ~consult-recoll-format-candidate~ to customize how
    search results are shown in the minibufer.  For instance, i like to
    shorten paths removing common prefixes and to show MIME types, so i use
    a formatter similar to this one:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun jao-recoll-format (title url mime-type)
        ;; remove from url the common prefixes /home/jao/{org/doc,doc,...}
        (let* ((u (replace-regexp-in-string "/home/jao/" "" url))
               (u (replace-regexp-in-string
                   "\\(doc\\|org/doc\\|.emacs.d/gnus/Mail\\|var/mail\\)/" "" u)))
          (format "%s (%s, %s)"
                  (propertize title 'face 'consult-recoll-title-face)
                  (propertize u 'face 'consult-recoll-url-face)
                  (propertize mime-type 'face 'consult-recoll-mime-face))))


      (setq consult-recoll-format-candidate #'jao-recoll-format)
    #+end_src

** Tip: displaying snippets in results list
    Instead of relying on a separate preview buffer to display snippets, you
    can set ~consult-recoll-inline-snippets~ to ~t~ to show them in the minibuffer,
    as individual candidates.

    [[https://codeberg.org/jao/consult-recoll/raw/branch/main/consult-recoll-inline.png]]

** Tip: disabling mime type groups
    By default, results are listed grouped by their mime type.  You can
    disable grouping by setting the customizable variable
    ~consult-recoll-group-by-mime~ to ~nil~.

    [[https://codeberg.org/jao/consult-recoll/raw/branch/main/consult-recoll-no-groups.png]]

* Opening search results
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: opening-results
   :END:

   When a search result candidate is selected, its MIME type is used to look
   up a function to open its associated file in the customizable variable
   ~consult-recoll-open-fns~.  If no entry is found, consult-recoll uses the
   value of ~consult-open-fn~ as a default.

   If ~consult-recoll-inline-snippets~ is set, the functions above take two
   arguments: the URL of the file to open and, if present, the snippet page
   number (or ~nil~ if it is not available, e.g., because the selected candidate
   is the one showing the document data)

** Example: PDF open with external viewer

    For instance, if you want to use ~zathura~ to open PDF documents, you could
    define an elisp helper like:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun open-pdf/zathura (file &optional page)
        (shell-command (format "zathura %s -P %s" file (or page 1))))
    #+end_src

    and then add it to ~consult-recoll-open-fns~:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'consult-recoll-open-fns
                   '("application/pdf" . open-pdf/zathura))
    #+end_src
